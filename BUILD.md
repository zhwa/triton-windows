## Branches in this repo

* `readme` contains changes to documentations, manually triggered workflows, and GitHub configs such as issue templates. These changes are orthogonal to the Windows support code. It's the default branch on GitHub for discoverability.
* `main` and `release/*.*.x` mirror the upstream repo https://github.com/triton-lang/triton .
* `main-windows` is based on `main` and contains the latest Windows support code.
* `main-windows-staged` is used to run CI when we are rebasing `main-windows` over the upstream.
* `release/*.*.x-windows` is based on the corresponding `release/*.*.x` and contains Windows support code cherry-picked from `main-windows`.

Pull requests should be made against `main-windows`, unless it's for a specific Triton version.

We prefer rebasing `main-windows` over the upstream rather than merging or cherry-picking the upstream. This means `main-windows` is often force-pushed.

When rebasing, we first push the rebased code to `main-windows-staged` and run CI, then fix CI errors on `main-windows-staged`, then reset `main-windows` to the latest commit on `main-windows-staged`. This ensures that the latest commit on `main-windows` always passes the CI.

In the published tags and wheels, the version of Windows support code is labeled like `post1`. It's mostly orthogonal to the Triton version. A newer version of Windows support code may be cherry-picked to an older version of Triton when needed.

## Build from source

The wheel can be built using either MSVC or clang-cl. In the following we use MSVC as an example.

MSVC v143 is required to build the wheel with LLVM from `oaitriton.blob.core.windows.net`. However, a binary built by a newer MSVC may not work with an older vcredist on the user's computer (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170#restrictions , which is a cause of `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing libtriton`). So the user needs to install the latest vcredist.

Set the binary, include, and library paths of Python, MSVC, Windows SDK, and CUDA in PowerShell (help wanted to automatically find these in CMake):
```pwsh
$Env:Path =
"C:\Windows\System32;" +
"C:\Python312;" +
"C:\Python312\Scripts;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.43.34808\bin\Hostx64\x64;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64;" +
"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd"
$Env:INCLUDE =
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.43.34808\include;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.26100.0\shared;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.26100.0\ucrt;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.26100.0\um;" +
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8\include;" +
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8\extras\CUPTI\include"
$Env:LIB =
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.43.34808\lib\x64;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.26100.0\ucrt\x64;" +
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.26100.0\um\x64"
```
* CUDA toolkit is only required when building LLVM in the offline build (`TRITON_OFFLINE_BUILD=1`)
* git is only required when building C++ unit tests (`TRITON_BUILD_UT=1`)
* cibuildwheel requires the binaries in `C:\Windows\System32\`

Then you can either download some dependencies online, or set up an offline build: (When switching between online/offline build, remember to delete `CMakeCache.txt`)

<details>
<summary>Download dependencies online</summary>

`setup.py` will download LLVM and JSON into the cache folder set by `TRITON_HOME` (by default `C:\Users\<your username>\.triton\`) and link against them. The LLVM is built by https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/.github/workflows/llvm-build.yml

A minimal CUDA toolchain (`ptxas.exe`, `cuda.h`, `cuda.lib`) and TinyCC will be downloaded and bundled in the wheel.

If you're in China, make sure to have a good Internet connection.

(For Triton <= 3.1, the pre-built LLVM is not provided. You still need to build LLVM and set `LLVM_SYSPATH`. Other dependencies can be automatically downloaded.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Offline build</summary>

Enable offline build:
```pwsh
$Env:TRITON_OFFLINE_BUILD = "1"
```

Build LLVM using MSVC according to the instructions of the official Triton:
```pwsh
# Check out the commit according to cmake/llvm-hash.txt (Sadly, you need to rebuild LLVM every week if you want to keep up to date)
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;llvm" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;NVPTX;AMDGPU" -DLLVM_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF -DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_DIA_SDK=OFF llvm
cmake --build build -j 8 --config Release
```
* See https://github.com/triton-lang/triton?tab=readme-ov-file#building-with-a-custom-llvm and https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/.github/workflows/llvm-build.yml
* When cloning LLVM, use `git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`. You don't want to clone the whole history as it's too large
* The official Triton enables `-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON` when compiling LLVM, and this will increase the binary size of Triton
* You may need to add the following compiler options to make MSVC happy, see https://reviews.llvm.org/D90116 and https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/65255:
```diff
diff --git a/llvm/CMakeLists.txt b/llvm/CMakeLists.txt

```

Download JSON according to `setup.py`:
* https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/include.zip

Set their paths:
```pwsh
$Env:LLVM_SYSPATH = "C:\llvm-project\build"
$Env:JSON_SYSPATH = "C:\json"
```
(For Triton <= 3.1, you also need to download pybind11 and set `PYBIND11_SYSPATH` according to `setup.py`)

The CUDA toolchain and TinyCC are not bundled by default in the offline build.
</details>

You can disable these if you don't need them: (`TRITON_BUILD_BINARY` is added in my fork. It can be enabled only if `TRITON_BUILD_UT` is enabled)
```pwsh
$Env:TRITON_BUILD_BINARY = "0"
$Env:TRITON_BUILD_PROTON = "0"
$Env:TRITON_BUILD_UT = "0"
```

I recommend to use ccache if you installed it:
```pwsh
$Env:TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CCACHE = "1"
```

Clone this repo, checkout `release/3.6.x-windows` branch, make an editable build using pip:
```pwsh
pip install --no-build-isolation --verbose -e .
# Or `pip install --no-build-isolation --verbose -e python` for Triton <= 3.3
```

Build the wheels: (This is for distributing the wheels to others. You don't need this if you only use Triton on your own computer)
```pwsh
git clean -dfX
$Env:CIBW_BUILD = "{cp310-win_amd64,cp311-win_amd64,cp312-win_amd64,cp313-win_amd64,cp314-win_amd64}"
$Env:CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY = "1"
$Env:TRITON_WHEEL_VERSION_SUFFIX = "+windows"
cibuildwheel .
# Or `cibuildwheel python` for Triton <= 3.3
```

If you see errors about defining `llvmGetPassPluginInfo` when building `lib/Instrumentation/PrintLoadStoreMemSpaces.cpp`, then you need to replace `LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK` with `__declspec(dllexport)` in `include/llvm/Passes/PassPlugin.h` of your LLVM, see https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/115431

## Set up GitHub Actions self-hosted runner

GPU is not required to build the wheel, but is required to run the unit tests.

1. Disable Windows Defender. This greatly reduces the time to run everything. See https://github.com/ionuttbara/windows-defender-remover
2. Enable [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#activate-developer-mode) of Windows. This allows the runner to create symlinks
3. Install environments:
    * Nvidia driver (if the machine has GPU. No need to install CUDA toolkit)
    * [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) (MSVC, Windows SDK)
    * Python (disable path length limit when installing)
    * Git
4. Install the runner: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners
    * Create a tag for the runner, and change the value of `runs-on:` in the workflow yml to this tag
    * Start the runner service after setting PATH of Python and Git

Then build the wheel and run the unit tests using https://github.com/triton-lang/triton-windows/blob/readme/.github/workflows/build-and-test-triton.yml

## Dev notes

* To implement `dlopen`:
    * For building the wheel, [dlfcn-win32](https://github.com/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32) is added to `thirdparty/` and linked in CMake, so I don't need to rewrite it every time
    * For JIT compilation, in `third_party/nvidia/backend/driver.c` and `driver.py` it's rewritten with `LoadLibrary`
* `python/triton/windows_utils.py` contains many ways to find the paths of Python, MSVC, Windows SDK, and CUDA
* ~~In `lib/Analysis/Utility.cpp` and `lib/Dialect/TritonGPU/Transforms/Utility.cpp`, explicit namespaces are added to support the resolution behaviors of MSVC~~ (This is no longer needed since Triton 3.3)
* ~~In `python/src/interpreter.cc` the GCC built-in `__ATOMIC` memory orders are replaced with `std::memory_order`~~ (Upstreamed, see https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/pull/4976 )
* ~~In `third_party/nvidia/backend/driver.py`, function `make_launcher`, `int64_t` should map to `L` in `PyArg_ParseTuple`. This fixes the error `Python int too large to convert to C long`.~~ (Upstreamed, see https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/pull/5351 )
